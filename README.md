# Deloitte-Tableau-Project
Deloitte Forage Data Analytics Project
This repository contains my work for **Task 1: Telemetry Data Dashboard** from the Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship (Forage).
## Project Overview
The goal of this task was to analyze telemetry data from the client's equipment to identify patterns in device downtime across different factories and device types. Using Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights for operational performance.

## Dashboard Visualizations
1. **Down Time per Device Type**
   - Highlights which device categories have the highest downtime.
   - Laser machines (LaserWelding, LaserCutting) show the most downtime.
   
2. **Down Time per Factory**
   - Compares downtime across factories.
   - Identifies factories with higher operational issues requiring attention.
## Key Insights
- Certain factories experience significantly higher downtime, indicating potential maintenance or operational issues.
- Laser-related machines contribute most to overall downtime.
- Smaller devices such as CNC, Conveyors, and SpotWelders perform consistently with minimal downtime.
- The dashboard can help management prioritize maintenance and reduce future downtime.

## Tools Used
- **Tableau** – for data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel / CSV** – for initial data exploration
- **GitHub** – for project hosting
